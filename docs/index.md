## What is this about?

Well, I face, in my PhD, a *difficult* problem. It is called **person re-identification** (**re-id** for friends).

Re-id consists in the retrieval of the same individual which moves through an environment covered by a set of heterogeneous surveillance cameras.

## Ok, why is this complicated?
